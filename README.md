Instructions

You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

Note

The key to the solusion is using the arguments object.

arguments is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

In other words, the arguments object is an object that stores all of the values passed to the function.
